# The Impact of Recreational Cannabis Legalization on Labour Productivity
*Causal evaluation of Canada’s 2018 cannabis legalization using the synthetic control method*

## Research Question

Did the legalization of recreational cannabis in Canada in 2018 causally affect labour productivity?

## Data

1. Labour productivity (USD per hour worked) from OECD

2. Annual data, 2000–2023

3. Donor pool: advanced economies with no cannabis legalization during the pre-treatment period

## Methodology

1. Applied the synthetic control method to construct a counterfactual for Canada

2. Selected donor countries based on pre-treatment fit

3. Evaluated post-treatment effects relative to the synthetic control

4. Conducted placebo and robustness checks

## Key Findings
1. Estimated decline in labour productivity of approximately $0.43 USD per hour worked by 2023

2. Effect is not statistically significant, indicating limited evidence of an aggregate productivity impact. Insignificance also be attributed to a short post-treatment period.
